        <p>
            This page documents the progress in output audio quality of the TTS solutions I’ve been working on, 
            and how they’ve evolved as I’ve built upon them.
            This page is purely for educational purposes and for demonstrating the quality of results.

        <p>
            Figure 1 illustrates the idea for the overall “pipeline” to create a state-of-the-art voice cloning solution.
            The concept was to take a strong Text-to-speech model, which would generate authentic flow, 
            and pair that with a Speech-to-speech model that could much better copy certain acoustic traits and details in accentuations.
        </p>
        <p>
            When deciding on a voice, I ideally wanted a fictional voice that would make for an interesting example, 
            and have a good amount of data to train with. I went for Ranni the Witch from Elden Ring, 
            as she had the largest amount of dialogue in the game (around 250 voice lines which amounted to roughly around ~20 mins of speaking audio).
        </p>
        <p>
            I will say that this was probably quite a difficult first voice to throw at it, and as you will see in the examples below the accent, pronunciations, and timbre are very unique, 
            and much of the vocab used in the dialogue is old-fashioned. Still, by the end of it we saw some incredible results, and I was very pleased with the overall quality and accuracy that was possible.
